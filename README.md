# 👋 Hi, I’m Ryan Salinas

I’m an **IT Field Technician** and **U.S. Army National Guard Officer** transitioning into **Software Engineering and Full-Stack Web Development**.  
My background combines **real-world systems troubleshooting**, **client-facing communication**, and a **Computer Science foundation** — giving me a unique edge in understanding both infrastructure and code.

## 💻 What I’m Working On

- 🌐 Building a **bilingual content management site** using **React, Next.js, and i18n** (English/Spanish toggle)
- ⚙️ Developing a **FastAPI backend** for cloud monitoring and automation dashboards
- 🧠 Expanding my knowledge in **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **REST API integration**
- 🧩 Exploring ways to connect **Azure/Google cloud administration** experience with modern app deployment

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Next.js, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind  
**Backend:** Node.js, FastAPI, Python  
**Database:** SQLite, PostgreSQL (learning)  
**Cloud / Infra:** Azure AD, Exchange Online, Windows Server, Datto RMM  
**Tools:** Git, VS Code, Docker (learning), PowerShell, Bash

## 🤖 AI-Augmented Development

I actively use tools like **ChatGPT** and **Cursor AI** to:
- Accelerate debugging and code review cycles  
- Explore new frameworks and best practices efficiently  
- Translate system troubleshooting experience into scalable code solutions  
- Prototype UI/UX ideas before formal implementation  

I view AI as a **force multiplier for engineering and learning**, not a replacement for skill.
